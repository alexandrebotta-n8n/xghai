Implemented Vercel Speed Insights integration following the official documentation guidelines.

## Summary

Updated the XGH-AI project to use Vercel Speed Insights for performance monitoring, replacing the deprecated Vercel Insights script with the new Speed Insights implementation.

## Files Modified

- **XGHAI/index.html** - Updated Vercel Insights initialization and script references

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Speed Insights Initialization Script
- Changed from `window.va` to `window.si` (Speed Insights object)
- Changed from `window.va.q` to `window.siq` (Speed Insights queue array)
- This follows the official Vercel Speed Insights documentation for HTML projects

### 2. Updated Script Source
- Changed from `/_vercel/insights/script.js` to `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`
- This ensures the correct tracking script is loaded when deployed to Vercel

## Implementation Details

Following the Vercel Speed Insights documentation for HTML projects, the integration includes:
- Proper initialization of the `window.si` function and `window.siq` queue before the script tag
- The defer attribute on the script tag for optimal performance
- The script is positioned in the head section where it won't block page rendering

## How This Works

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. The initialization script sets up the `window.si` global function
2. The speed tracking script loads and automatically instruments Core Web Vitals
3. Performance metrics are collected and sent to Vercel's dashboard
4. Data appears in the Speed Insights tab of the Vercel dashboard

## Next Steps for User

1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project Settings → Speed Insights)
2. Deploy the changes to Vercel (git push)
3. Allow a few days for data collection from users
4. View performance metrics in the Speed Insights dashboard tab
